# ETL-Pipeline-Project
This project implements a complete ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Python, SQL and Excel. It reads raw customer data, cleans and standardizes it, and loads the cleaned data into MySQL and PostgreSQL databases. It also generates metadata about the processed data.
